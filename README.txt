I made a class called 'Server' which has two strings as private arguments: the client's name and its message. The first constructor initializes the strings with an undefined value. The following is the copy constructor that copies the values to the current object ('this'). Then we have 2 methods that return the value (name and message).

In main I did a while reading because it had to read to endl and then I added everything to an object that I added to the object vector.

I did the command line interface with 'cout' to give instructions on how to enter the data on the keyboard.
